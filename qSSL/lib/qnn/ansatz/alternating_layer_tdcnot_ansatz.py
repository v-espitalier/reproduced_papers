    A variational circuit ansatz. Prepares quantum circuit object for variational circuit consisting of thinly
    dressed C-NOT gates applied to pairs of qubits in an alternating layer pattern. A single sweep consists of two
    applications of thinly-dressed gates between nearest neighbour qubits, with alternating pairs between the two
    applications. The thinly dressed C-NOT gate is define in arXiv:2002.04612, we use single qubit Y rotations
    preceding and single qubit X rotations following the C-NOT gate.
